Welcome to MOD 1 Gap curriculum. We’ve designed these materials to help get you up to speed and ready to get the most out of your Flatiron experience.

The curriculum is designed to be easy at parts, challenging in others. A lot of it is designed around common errors that beginning developers encounter when they’re first getting started. Take your time going through, it is important that you thoroughly understand everything before you repeat.

A bit about repetition and feedback.

There’s a lot of repetition built into the Flatiron curriculum. It’s not expected that you’ll get everything right on the first try, in fact it’s often better if you don’t. Mistakes are typically the best learning experiences.

For instance, when you write something incorrectly in a lab, Learn gives you appropriate error messages and expectations. We ask you to repeat the exercise. This is us giving you feedback. And you need to take that feedback and use it to improve on your next attempt.

We have asked you to repeat MOD 1. This is us giving you feedback. And as with a lab, you need to take that feedback and use it to improve on your next attempt.

Same principal.

And just as you wouldn’t take the feedback of the error messages in the IDE as anything other than feedback, as something you can learn from, I would advise you to take us asking you to repeat MOD 1 as nothing other than feedback. Something you’re meant to learn from.

In the next section, we’re going to go over some error messages that might be applicable to you, and then after that we’ll go through a series of coding exercises to help you understand the principles of learning to code.

To show my commitment to you in making this curriculum as useful as possible, feel free to email me personally if you find a portion of the curriculum that is unclear or could be better. I’d love to hear from you.

Historically at FIS, repeat students have positive experiences during their second attempt and walk away more effective than those who "barely made it." 

This is a leap-frogging opportunity for you.

Additionally, some repeat students have become leaders in their repeat-cohort, have shared the positive changes with the cohort and have found great influence and learning by "paying it forward." Be one of these people, you’ll learn so much by helping others.

We’ve found that most students who have success coming out of the repeat follow a similar process. 

The process in repeating MOD 1 is the same as the process in code.
Recognize the negative feedback 
Locate the point of error 
Plan a correction
Practice and test the updated behavior
Move on!

Now let’s begin by finding your error message. We typically see similar patterns in repeat students, think through your experience this far and try to see if any of the following fit for you. 

Typical errors. 

Failing to understand what programming is
Are you just trying to pass the tests or do you try to understand how you’re solving the problem?  
Or are you just randomly putting in code bits until the test pass
When you start a lab, do you take time to understand the problem you are trying to solve?
Are you able to understand the flow of operations in code? Do you have a process for following a method from its inputs, step through its implementation and identify what your output will look like?"
Do you figure out what inputs you have, what your output will look like and designing a logical flow of operations to take you from input to output? 
Memorizing patterns of code rather than making the code match a vision of the solution in your head
Are you just copy / pasting solutions from Learn or Google and adjusting it to fit the lab? 
Are you often reworking old code until to get tests to pass? 
Lack of comfort with using core Ruby structures like Arrays, Hashes, & built in methods
Do you feel that you fully grasp data types like Arrays and Hashes and their built in methods? 
You can grasp what’s happening in a program but perhaps (Steven I’m not sure what this looks like) 
Lack of comfort with using core Ruby Enumerables to transform, update, pare-down data in Arrays and Hashes
Do you have a clear understanding of the difference between common enumerables and are you able to choose the correct enumerable for a task?
Do you sometimes get stuck and try different methods to see what works?
Do you default to using `each` or `map` on arrays and try to make it work?
(Steven)
Methods so confusing even you can’t debug it
Are your methods dozens of lines long and passing data from one place to another within the same method? 
When your code breaks can you pinpoint the place easily where something is going wrong? 
Do you have trouble understanding what’s happening in code you wrote more than a few weeks ago? 
Lack of comfort with using Object Orientation to help organize and maintain code
Do you feel comfortable taking a set of related Ruby methods and building them into a class?
Can you come up clear analogies of the following relationships between Ruby classes:
Class one has many of class two. Class two belongs to class one.
Class one has many of class two. Class two also has many of class one.
Class one has many of class two and class three. Both class two and class three belong to class one.
	
Above are the most common errors that beginner programmers make, take some time and think about which of these fit you best. Remember, Locate the point of error. After you’ve got a sense of where you’ve gone off course, plan your correction. What are you going to do instead? Check in with an instructor or TCF to see if this is a reasonable course of action. 

Remember, whenever you hit an error and need to repeat - follow the following process. 

The process in repeating MOD 1 is the same as the process in code.
Recognize the negative feedback 
Locate the point of error 
Plan a correction
Practice and test the updated behavior
Move on!
