# Where are You Now?

## A Word from the Curriculum Director

Welcome to MOD 1 Gap curriculum. We've designed these materials to help get you
up to speed and ready to get the most out of your Flatiron experience.

The curriculum is designed to be easy at parts, challenging in others. A lot of
it is designed around common errors that beginning developers encounter when
they're first getting started. Take your time going through, it is important
that you thoroughly understand everything before you repeat.

A bit about repetition and feedback.

There's a lot of repetition built into the Flatiron curriculum. It's not
expected that you'll get everything right on the first try, in fact it's often
better if you don't. Mistakes are often the best learning experiences.

For instance, when you write something incorrectly in a lab, Learn gives you
appropriate error messages and expectations. It tells you didn't _quite_ do the
right thing and tries to provide feedback to steer you in a more correct
direction. We hope that in a subsequent challenge you won't make the same
mistakes: the _feedback_ will guide you to a _positive_ outcome.

In the same way, we have asked you to repeat MOD 1. This is us giving you
feedback. As with a lab, **you** need to take that feedback and use it to
improve on your next attempt.

In the next section, we're going to go over some behaviors that negatively
affect students success in our program. We call those "anti-patterns." We'd
encourage you to remove or alter any anti-patterns as you follow this course.
Students rarely fail because they didn't know some detail of the programming
language, they usually fail because they didn't have a work process that kept
them in control of the code, versus the reverse.

To show my commitment to you in making this curriculum as useful as possible,
feel free to email me personally if you find a portion of the curriculum that
is unclear or could be better. I'd love to hear from you.

## Perspective

Historically at FIS, repeat students have positive experiences during their
second attempt and walk away more effective than those who "barely made it."
Remember, FIS is not about "getting a passing grade" &mdash; our focus is on
learning the skills you need to earn a spot on a development team.  This is a
leap-frogging opportunity for you.

Additionally, some repeat students have chosen to become leaders in their
repeat-cohort.  By viewing this gap time and material as an opportunity to
sharpen up they have chosen to "pay it forward" and be a friend to all, a
master debugger, and a source of strength. These individuals not only complete
our program but go on to have strong interviewing skills in the interpersonal
dimension that make them very attractive prospects for hire.  Be one of these
people, you'll learn so much by helping others.

We've found that most students who have success coming out of the repeat follow
a similar process to those who learn from their code / learn from the tests in
Learn:

They:

* Recognize the negative feedback
* Locate the point of error
* Plan a correction
* Update their default process to avoid falling into the same traps
* Practice and test the updated behavior
* Move on!

## Reflection

Now let's begin by finding weaker points in your process. We typically see
similar patterns in repeat students. Think through your experience this far and
try to see if any of the following fit for you.

Typical errors:

1.  Failing to understand what programming _is_: Finding solutions on the
    internet or imagining a "hole" and what kind of thing fits in that "hole"
2.  Trying to pass the tests or do you try to understand how they're trying to
    improve your approach to solving the problem?
3.  Putting in complicated code, guessing, flailing, hoping the next random
    pasted bit passes the test (see 1) instead of making a hypothesis, testing
    it in IRB or with some debugging output before putting it in
4.  Not taking time to understand the problem the lab is trying to solve
5.  Not asking for help when the instructions are unclear
6.  Over-relying on the debugger / `binding.pry`: do you trace code flow before
    you run the program and poke around while it's running? While using a
    debugger well is definitely a great skill to have, over-reliance on it will
    hurt you in whiteboard interviews and in situations where a debugger might not
    be available.
7.  Not taking time to ensure you understand your inputs, have an expectation
    of output and an idea of the best or most focused method to make the inputs
    produce the outputs
8.  Copying and pasting: those tools are designed to help people's fingers
    avoid work, not to spare developers' brains the work of understanding the
    code.
9.  Not doing the dirty work: When you have an 80 line method to do something
    that should be simple and you're totally confused about the nested
    if/elses...do you buckle down and clean up the method, or do you keep adding
    more knots to the ball of knots. Be responsible. "Work Clean" as Anthony
    Bourdain said.
10. Failing to invest in mastery of the core tools of the Ruby environment:
    `Arrays`, `Hash`es, `Enumerables`, and built in methods. You should feel so
    friendly towards these characters that when you see a problem that calls for
    them you feel _comfortable_ and relaxed.
11. Failing to "edit" your code. Just like writing a blog post or a tweet you
    can write it, but with careful eyes and patience you can ask "Is this as
    brief as it could _while also_ being easy to understand?" Code should
    primarily help humans communicate about strategies for solving problems. That
    it also passes tests / runs real fast on computers is a side benefit.
12. Preferring to copy and paste similar bits of code instead of creating
    named, "helper" methods
13. Never looking back: Can you understand code you wrote more than a few weeks
    ago? When you look back to you see clear improvement?
14. Failing to get "the point" of Object Orientation
15. Failing to become comfortable with changing procedural code to OO and
    vice-versa

Above are the most common behavior errors ("anti-patterns") that beginner
programmers make. Take some time and think about which of these describe you.
Remember, Locate the point of error. After you've got a sense of where you've
gone off course, plan your correction. What are you going to do instead? Check
in with an instructor or TCF to see if this is a reasonable course of action.

Remember, whenever you hit an error and need to repeat - follow the following
process.

The process in repeating MOD 1 is the same as the process in code.

* Recognize the negative feedback
* Locate the point of error
* Plan a correction
* Update their default process to avoid falling into the same traps
* Practice and test the updated behavior
* Move on!
